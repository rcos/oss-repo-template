## Reading Assignment
More suggestions on how to answer questions in a helpful way:
1. Include as much detail as necessary to mitigate any potential confusion your answer may bring to others.
2. Reference things that the asker understands so they have something to mentally reference, ultimately increasing your answer's comprehension. (e.g To explain inheritence to someone, you could explain that Cows and Chicken are animals, so they inherit similar traits that animals have).

## Free Culture
After reading chapter 3 of Free Culture, it became clear to me the importance of respecting the copyrights set in place. In the case explained in chapter 3, Jesse Jordan only had a mere enthusiasm of how a technology worked. He wanted to see if he could create a search system that also routed through private files for everyone within that network. I would not have guess that this would be basis for a lawsuit by the RIAA in the figure of millions of dollars. It was not as if the natur eof the project Jordan was developing had a mission to pirate music, but inevitably, it provided grounds for others to do so, and he was held liable. What could have possibly prevented this was a strong Terms of Service that absolved him of any potential piracy, which would ultimately pass the responsibility onto the user who made the music public. But who knows.
