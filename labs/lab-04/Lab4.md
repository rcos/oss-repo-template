### Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
It is important to choose your license because you want to be able to control what 
other people can use your project for. If you do not put a license on the project, other
people can take your code and use it as they please without your objection because
there is no license document assigned with the project.

### Why is it important that you **SHOULDN'T** use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
It is important that you should not use a project that does not have an explicit license 
because you never know what could happen to the project in the future. At any point, it could
get a license that restricts its availability/usability and that project that was previously a
dependency for you is no longer available due to license restriction. Additionally, if you
contribute to a project without your license, the project owner can run off with your work by
accepting your contribution then making the project proprietory to sell.

### Why the Web beat Gopher, *Failure to follow the Open System Model*
I agree with the author's statement that the Gopher team should have opened the project up to
the public and allowed more people to decide on the uses for the program, to some regard. This
would allow people who had some use case for the application that it wasn't currently super focused
on to improve upon that use case. But, just the same way, this could cause the misdirection of a
project because it expects the owners to open up their scope for the project to take other use
cases into consideration even though it may not be the current focus for the applicatin.

### [Linux and GPLv2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2)
It would make sense for the Linux Operating System to have the GPLv2 license because their mission
is to create an open source operating system that is free to the public. This license allows them
to work towards this mission without the chance of their work being stoken or limiting their software
from being used for free by the public.
